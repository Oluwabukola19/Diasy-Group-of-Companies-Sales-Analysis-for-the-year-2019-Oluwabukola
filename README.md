OBSERVATIONS

1.Karen Daniels is the best performing sales rep in the east region,he had the highest in July,he made use of the COD payment mode for his customers  that bought machines from him. He also used the standard class of ship mode within New york state.




2.The sales rep from the west region sold furnishings and supplies but he had more sales in furnisings and he made use of the second class ship mode.

He used two payments mode(COD and Cards) but he had customers that made use of  cards more in California.




3.Kareen Faguson performed below average, he sold mobile phones and paper in California,he made use of the first class ship mode







RECOMMENDATIONS

I recommend that sales rep with low performance should note the following.

1.The ship mode;they need to study their region and distance between state,as this will help them to use an affordable ship mode.

2.The payment mode:From the analysis,customers from East region made use of the COD,sales rep in other region should also include this in their payment mode.
